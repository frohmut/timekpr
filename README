History
=======

 - This is a complete re-write in python and vast improvement from the original 
timekpr bash script: http://tinyurl.com/waggledanceblog
 - This project was born after Charles Jackson's (crjackson) request for a 
program that time-limits user accounts: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=887769
 - Even Nedberg initially began to improve the original bash script from Chris 
Jackson, Savvas Radević packaged it and soon began co-development.
 - timekpr is now in experimental mode, highly unstable. Expect changes and a 
release that will be more distributable.

Thanks
======

 Special thanks go to Charles Jackson (crjackson), who has contributed a lot by 
suggesting and brainstorming useful features, as well as reporting bugs. We 
would also like to thank all the people posting at that topic at ubuntuforums 
for their helpful suggestions, tests and bug reports!
 Also thanks to Nicolas Laurance, who has pointed us to the proper python 
documentation and coding style.
 Finally, a huge thank you to the translators and bug triagers/reporters!
