History
=======

 - This is a complete re-write in python and vast improvement from the original timekpr bash script: http://tinyurl.com/waggledanceblog
 - This project was born after Charles Jackson's (crjackson) request for a program that time-limits user accounts: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=887769
 - Even Nedberg initially began to improve the original bash script from Chris Jackson, Savvas RadeviÄ‡ packaged it and soon began co-development.
 - timekpr is now in experimental mode, highly unstable. Expect changes and a release that will be more distributable.

Thanks
