* Add more tooltips to GUI
* Implement i18n support

* Should we use 'who' to get a list of users and then log them out using 'pkill -u <username>' instead of getting username and pid
  if x-session-manager?
  x-session-manager gives us a problem making the daemon work in XFCE, 'who' and 'pkill' will fix this
  x-session-manager gives us a problem with the "Hardy Hack" preventing the daemon from working with KDE, 'who' and 'pkill' will not do this
  Logging out a user with 'pkill' is not nice, but we will warn them and data loss will happen the way it is also if they don't log out!
  To use 'who' and 'pkill' will will have to move notificatios out of the daemon and into the client. This would, imo, be a better solution than the current as the client will know what DE the user is running.

* Move most of the logic in the while-loop of timekpr.py into timekprcommon.py
  That way it can be used by timekpr-client.py without the need to rewrite the code

* Lock users at first logout
  Remove .lock from the while-loop

* PAM time and access modules:
  add to /etc/pam.d/gdm and /etc/pam.d/login

* Debian package:
  Suggests: gdm or Recommends: gdm ?

* Manual:
  docbook? http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/sgml-howto/x165.html
  *OR* debiandoc? http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/sgml-howto/x306.html

* Check out "memory files": http://docs.python.org/lib/module-StringIO.html

* Idea: to make a timekpr-client.py that would run using
 /etc/xdg/autostart/, somehow sending with dbus or with
 some other way (username.message?)

* Support xfce4-session, gnome-session and kde session
  GNOME:
    /usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop
    /etc/pam.d/gdm

  XFCE:
    /usr/share/xsessions/xfce4.desktop
    /etc/pam.d/xdm

  KDE4:
    /usr/share/xsessions/kde4.desktop
    /etc/pam.d/kdm-kde4

  KDE3: (?)
    /usr/share/xsessions/kde.desktop
    /etc/pam.d/kdm

* testing/timekpr-gui and testing/timekpr.glade
 "Clear all restrictions" will clear all limits and all files related (.logout .late etc..)
 "Reset time" will remove the .time file
 "Bypass for today" will be "timekpr-extend" (Will set "0000-2400" in time.conf for today)
 "Unlock account" will set user in access.conf
 Also figure out a way for bypass, e.g. comment at the end of the line or in a file?

* testing/timekpr.glade - we need easily understandable tooltips!

* timekpr.py: Setting to disable/enable limiting users in groups admin/wheel? (or just disable them by default?)
  http://bugs.launchpad.net/timekpr/+bug/286529

* timekprpam.py: blacklist hours in between - this should use a time.conf line such as:
  *;*;username;Mo0800-2230&!1200-1500 & Tu0800-2230
  for the gui of such an improvement, we should add a gtk.DrawingArea box for each day, one box per half an hour

less script, more objects ?
^ Nicolas, what do you mean? Please edit the line and explain a bit more
