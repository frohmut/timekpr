For developers
===============

Currently the project REQUIRES python >= 2.5
If you want to see other dependencies, check out the file 
debian/control at the branch

Install bazaar:
- fedora: yum install bzr
- ubuntu: sudo apt-get install bzr
- debian (debian-based): apt-get install bzr

If you want to learn how to use bazaar, please read:
http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/latest/en/mini-tutorial/index.html

Please note that the timekpr branch is NOT a testbed for 
launchpad testing! If you want to test functions of the 
launchpad, please register a personal "junk" branch:
https://code.launchpad.net/~yourusername/+addbranch
(where yourusername is your launchpad account username)

When you are editing and adding new stuff, please be clear as to 
_every detail_ you have changed (summarize them in topics if there 
are a lot of changes).
