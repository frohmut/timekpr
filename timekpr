## CONFIGURE START - You can change the following values:

# (default_limit is not used anymore!)

# This is the grace period, where a notification pops up letting the users
# know that their time usage will be over soon.
# Users are given by default 120 seconds to finish up their work.
# Limit is expressed in seconds, e.g. 120 means 2 minutes
grace_period=120

# How often should the script check the timelogs.
# Setting is expressed in seconds, e.g. 45 means 45 seconds.
poll_time=45

# When are the users allowed to login, uncomment to enable
# (remove the '#' character in the following line).
#from=( 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 )

# Users will no longer be allowed to login after this time/hour
# (24-hour format), e.g. 22 means after 10 o'clock pm.
#to=( 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 )

#Create a log?
DEBUGME='yes'
LOGF='/var/log/timekpr.log'

#Default lock period
#Setting can be day(s), hour(s), minute(s)
#Example: 5 hours

## killing gnome-session should be more like:
	#DISPLAY=":0" XAUTHORITY="/tmp/.gdmEQ0V5T" SESSION_MANAGER="local/wretched:/tmp/.ICE-unix/$pid" su -c 'gnome-session-save --kill --silent' $username
## but this can still leave processes to cleanup - plus it's not easy to get SESSION_MANAGER
