## CONFIGURE START - You can change the following values:

# FIXME: Bad explanation, is this a time limit for one day?
# The default limit is used to set a time limit.
# New users are given by default a limit of 86400 seconds.
# The limit is expressed in seconds, e.g. 86400 means all day
default_limit=86400

# This is the grace period, where a notification pops up letting the users
# know that their time usage will be over soon.
# Users are given by default 120 seconds to finish up their work.
# Limit is expressed in seconds, e.g. 120 means 2 minutes
grace_period=120

# FIXME: Bad explanation, is it seconds or minutes?
# How often should the script check the timelogs
poll_time=45

# When are the users allowed to log in, uncomment to enable
# (remove the '#' character in the following line).
#from=7

# Users will no longer be allowed to log in after this time/hour
# (24-hour format), e.g. 22 means after 10 o'clock pm.
#to=22

## CONFIGURE END - Do not edit after this line!

# FIXME: should really check to see if user has logged out yet 
	kill -HUP $pid #this is a pretty bad way of killing a gnome-session, but we warned 'em
	touch $TIMEKPRDIR/$username.logout

## uncomment the following to brutally kill all of the users processes
#	sleep 5
#	pkill -u $username

## killing gnome-session should be more like:
	#DISPLAY=":0" XAUTHORITY="/tmp/.gdmEQ0V5T" SESSION_MANAGER="local/wretched:/tmp/.ICE-unix/$pid" su -c 'gnome-session-save --kill --silent' $username
## but this can still leave processes to cleanup - plus it's not easy to get SESSION_MANAGER
