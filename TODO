* PAM time and access modules:
  add to /etc/pam.d/gdm and /etc/pam.d/login

* Debian package:
  Suggests: gdm or Recommends: gdm ?

* Manual:
  docbook? http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/sgml-howto/x165.html
  *OR* debiandoc? http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/sgml-howto/x306.html

* Check out "memory files": http://docs.python.org/lib/module-StringIO.html

* Idea: to make a timekpr-client.py that would run using
 /etc/xdg/autostart/, somehow sending with dbus or with
 some other way (username.message?)

* Support xfce4-session, gnome-session and kde session
  GNOME:
    /usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop
    /etc/pam.d/gdm

  XFCE:
    /usr/share/xsessions/xfce4.desktop
    /etc/pam.d/xdm

  KDE4:
    /usr/share/xsessions/kde4.desktop
    /etc/pam.d/kdm-kde4

  KDE3: (?)
    /usr/share/xsessions/kde.desktop
    /etc/pam.d/kdm

* testing/timekpr-gui and testing/timekpr.glade
 "Clear all restrictions" will clear all limits and all files related (.logout .late etc..)
 "Reset time" will remove the .time file
 "Bypass for today" will be "timekpr-extend" (Will set "0000-2400" in time.conf for today)
 "Unlock account" will set user in access.conf
 Also figure out a way for bypass, e.g. comment at the end of the line or in a file?

* testing/timekpr.glade - we need easily understandable tooltips!

* timekpr.py: Setting to disable/enable limiting users in groups admin/wheel? (or just disable them by default?)
