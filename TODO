* Pythonize timekpr! :)

* Checkout the PAM module:
 /etc/pam.d/login
 /etc/security/access.conf
 /etc/security/time.conf
 /etc/pam.d/gdm
 to apply, restart the service, i.e. /etc/init.d/gdm reload

* Idea: to make a timekpr-client.py that would run using
 /etc/xdg/autostart/, somehow sending with dbus or with
 some other way (username.message?)
