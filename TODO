* PAM time and access modules:
  add to /etc/pam.d/gdm and /etc/pam.d/login

* Debian package:
  Suggests: gdm or Recommends: gdm ?

* Check out "memory files": http://docs.python.org/lib/module-StringIO.html

* Idea: to make a timekpr-client.py that would run using
 /etc/xdg/autostart/, somehow sending with dbus or with
 some other way (username.message?)
